I am currently the vehicle structures lead of Purdue Space Program's liquid rocket team. We are currently designing a 2400 lbf Ethanol/LOx rocket targeting 65,000 ft: Crater-Maker Special (CMS).

In spring/summer 2022 we launched our previous vehicle, BZB, three times reaching 11,000 ft. My work focused on integration and testing of the recovery system, and machining flight hardware.

Before becoming structures lead on CMS, I developed a program to calculate vehicle's bending load profile due to aerodynamic and inertial loads and led exploration of composite manufacturing techniques and destructive testing campaign for a structural carbon fiber airframe.

Additionally, as Fin Can Responsible Engineer, I drove system and component design of lower airframe's strut structure, fin attachment/alignment, and plumbing access, and optimized airframe struts for mass considering failure in bending, lateral buckling, and torsional buckling.

I'm currently leading the structures team of 35 students, where I manage responsible engineers, and direct the design-test-manufacture process. This position pushes me to focus on the integration of our structural systems with fluids, propulsion, and avionics as well as mentoring new members on design, analysis, and manufacturing techniques.
