As my high school senior project, I designed a small table that could be folded into the size of a binder and fit into a backpack. It could be used in the hallways at lunch, camping, at the beach etc.

The tabletop uses an origami folding pattern, and the legs are completely collapsible. Since I did not complete the school year in person due to covid, no prototype was built, but instead I simulated the table's structural performance to determine which leg components should be metal, and which should be plastic.

This was my first real engineering project, as I learned how to design in CAD, 3D print, and do structural FEA on my own over the course of the semester.
