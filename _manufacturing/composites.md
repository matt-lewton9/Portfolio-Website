I'm on the composites subteam of Purdue Space Program Liquids. We're designing and manufacturing a structural carbon fiber airframe and fins.

We started by making carbon fiber tubes with wet layup vacuum bagging around a mandrel. However, we have had issues with fiber volume fractoion and wrinkling, so we will be moving to oven cured prepreg fabric in a two piece vacuum bagged mold.

I am using Ansys ACP to design and simulate the strength of composite airframes. We will be running experimental tests to validate the accuracy of our simulations before making the final airframe.

I also made a fiberglass airframe for my L1 high power rocket. Check previous posts for {% include url.html url="https://mattlewton.me/2022/07/03/fiberglass.html" text="manufacturing" %} and {% include url.html url="https://mattlewton.me/2022/07/08/fg_test.html" text="testing and defects" %}.
