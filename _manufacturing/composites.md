On Purdue Space Program Liquids I am leading the design-manufacture-test campaign for composites. We are making structural airframe sections, fins, a nosecone, and airframe panels, using oven cured prepreg fabric in a two piece vacuum bagged mold. The mold itself is tooling prepreg cured over a male mold of the part. We are also hand wrapping our engine in silica phenolic ablative with a carbon fiber / epoxy overwrap.

I am using Ansys ACP to design and simulate the strength of composite airframes. We will be running experimental tests to validate the accuracy of our simulations before making the final airframe.

I also made a fiberglass airframe from scratch for my L1 high power rocket. Check previous posts for {% include url.html url="https://mattlewton.me/2022/07/03/fiberglass.html" text="manufacturing" %} and {% include url.html url="https://mattlewton.me/2022/07/08/fg_test.html" text="testing and defects" %}.

We are currently in the process of destructively testing scale carbon fiber airframes to characterize skin buckling failure with our manufacturing techniques/quality.
