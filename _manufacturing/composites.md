I'm on the composites subteam of Purdue Space Program Liquids. We're designing and manufacturing a structural carbon fiber airframe and fins.

We made our carbon fiber tubes with wet layup vacuum bagging around a mandrel. However, we have had issues with resin density and wrinkles, so we will be pivoting to oven cured prepreg fabric in a two piece vacuum bagged mold.

I am using Ansys ACP to design and simulate the strength of composite airframes. We will be running experimental tests to validate the accuracy of our simulations before making the final airframe.

This summer, I am running a subscale version of next semester's design-simulate-validate test campaign with a fiberglass airframe on an L1 high power solid rocket. Check out <a href="{{ "https://mattlewton.me/pages/blog.html" | relative_url }}" class="link" >Latest Projects</a> for updates!
