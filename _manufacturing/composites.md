I'm the Structures Lead of Purdue Space Program Liquids

We are making structural airframe tubes and nonstrucutral airframe panels, and the nosecone using oven cured prepreg fabric in a two piece vacuum bagged mold. The mold itself is tooling prepreg cured over a male mold of the part. 

We understand that the "correct" way to make parts at this scale (5 ft long, 9.5" OD) is with filament winding, however there are no filament winders that can support our rocket's OD. We actually tried to build a filament winder, it was my first project on the team and I learned a ton about filament winding, but the project was cancelled after it became clear that it was a resource sink.

I am using Ansys ACP to design and simulate the strength of composite airframes. We will be running experimental tests to validate the accuracy of our simulations before making the final airframe.

I also made a fiberglass airframe for my L1 high power rocket. Check previous posts for {% include url.html url="https://mattlewton.me/2022/07/03/fiberglass.html" text="manufacturing" %} and {% include url.html url="https://mattlewton.me/2022/07/08/fg_test.html" text="testing and defects" %}.
