I've been FDM 3D printing since high school . I mostly print mechanical projects, and I'm able to consistently get clearence, transition, and interference fits. I've also done multimaterial printing with a Palette 2S. 




Nutcrackers of my friends as gifts. I submitted them to a r/3Dprinting stocking stuffer competition and won a Voxelab Aquilla!
