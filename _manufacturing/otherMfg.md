## Welding

I've started to learn welding at Purdue's Bechtel Innovation and Design Center. After initial training I TIG welded this soda can holder of my own design from 1/4" laser cut sheet steel. Surprisingly, the hardest part was figuring out how to hold the slats in a circular pattern as I welded them, definitely  an oversight in design.

## 3D Printed T-Shirts

You can use a 3D printer to print temporary or permanent patterns on t-shirts. They're great for one-off shirts for a party, or personalized gifts.

PLA patterns usually come off after a handful of washes, while TPU is permanent. The challenge is keeping the shirt in tension, so the extruder doesn't catch in the shirt and burn the fabric.
