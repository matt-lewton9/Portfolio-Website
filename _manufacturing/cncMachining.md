I work as a Peer Mentor at the Bechtel Innovation Design Center (BIDC) at Purdue, where I'm functionally a student machinist, and mentor users of the manufacturing shop in the fabrication and design of their projects. I advise students while they create their CAM, and guide them through using the equipment.

At BIDC, I've had the opportunity to work with Bridgeport manual mills, as well as a Haas VF-2 and a 5 axis VF-4 mills, and Haas ST20 series CNC lathes.
