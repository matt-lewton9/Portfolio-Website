<p>What motivates me as an engineer is expanding the breadth of problems I can solve, or
    more plainly: the cool stuff I can make. I am constant learner, whether its new a programming language,
    manufacturing technique, or a project idea I can't stop thinking about. I am always looking for ways to 
    improve and develop new skills.

This website is both a portfolio of past projects and a place to share what I'm currently working on. 
I consider it a hybrid of documentation and personal journal. Enjoy!
