title: Molded Fiberglass Airframe
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

I' making molded fiberglass tubes for a rocket airframe. I'm using doing an interior molded wet layup as a pilot project for PSP Liquids in the fall. The objective as to practice manufacturing tubes via an interior mold, and get an airframe for my L1 attempt out of it. I also ran a compressive strength test to varify ANSYS simulations before making my final airframe components.

I 3D printed a two piece mold, that uses 4 tight fit alignment pins, so the two halves of the mold snap together are in a tight alignment. The molds have bolt holes to clamp them together, but I found that a wood clamp was easier.

I used Fiberglast 4 oz fiberglass fabric and Totalboat high performance two part epoxy resin. A wet layup is suceptible to dry spots and other irregularities, but I don't have an oven or high temperature molds required to cure prepregs. I used a party balloon as a bladder to provid a compresssive force to increase my fiber volume fraction. It's no vaccuum bag, but I was only interested in seeing if wrinkling occurred.
