title: Fiberglass tube Manufacturing

I made interior molded mandrel wrapped fiberglass tubes to compare the manufacturing difficulty of each method. In a few days after they cure, I'll also do compressive test to compare their strengths. All of these were wet layups sized for my the L1 rocket I'm working on, but it's also an early test of manufacturing processes for PSP liquids, which would be in prepreg with a vaccum bag.

Both tubes are 8" long, 2" OD tubes with [0]4 fiberglass in a wet layup. Both tubes used mold release film against the 3D printed tools, and peel ply on the outermost layer

## Interior Molding
I followed a method I saw on Easy Composites, where the layers on each side of the mold are staggered, so the seam where the two halves overlap is different for each layer. 

One half of the mold has fiberglass extending beyond the top face, and the other side has fiberglass recessed. My "extended side" (right) had each consecutive layer increase by .25"  My "recessed side"(left) had layer size decrease by .125". These increments are similar to the 5 mm and 3mm increments proposed by easy composites.

Laying the fiberglass into the molds was pretty straightfoward. My fingers were may more affective than my brush at spreading the epoxy on the interior contour of the mold. There was not as clean of a staggering pattern as in the Easy Composites video since it was a wet layup, and the fiberglass was very maleable, but most of the staggering was achieived. It is very achievable for a student or hobbyist to get a clean stagger with prepreg.

To put the mold halves together, I bent the protruding fiberglass on the extended half inward, and put the two halves of the mold together (the molds had alignment pins, a MUST.) 

Adding peel ply to the mold was tricky. I made two pieces of peel ply, each .25" larger than the mold halves. I put the peel ply on the extended  side mold normally, but not on the smaller half. Since the peel ply is larger than the recessed fiberglass, it would completely cover the inside of the mold, not allowing the fiberglass halves to bond. To get around this, I folded the peel ply and placed it in the center of the recessed mold. Once the mold was closed, it was pretty easy to unfold the peel ply, the smooth it and add resin with a popsicle stick. 

As you can see, the inside of the mold is still pretty wavy and not cylindrical. To add some pressure, I inflated a cylindrical party balloon inside the mold to add pressure while the resin cured for the first hour or so. After that, the balloon lost pressure, but it left the fiberglass compressed with a smooth finish.

Preparing the fiberglass with this method took a lot longer, since each piece had to be individually cut, but so far the result is much nicer than the mandrel.

## Mandrel Wrap
The Mandrel wrap wasn't anything special. I 3d printed a cylindrical mandrel and a (horribly designed and rushed but cool looking) holder, I wrapped 4 layers of continous fiberglass, adding a lot of resin, and an outer layer of peel ply.

I am not applying a compressive force on this tube for a few reasons. One, I don't have a vaccum pump, so i would have to use shrink tape, which I would need to buy. Two, It will tell me the uncompressed thickness of this particular laminate with these materials, so I can assess the performence of the mold and balloon. Third, on a large scale tube, we can't compress a mandrel wrap withoug creating wrinkles, so I want to see how bad the knockdown is without compression. There are two noticable bumps on the tube. That is where I taped the mold film to the mandrel. It shouldn't have much of an impact on the performence, but it's worth noting.

## What's Next

Once these cure, I will be running a compressive strength test of each tube. I will also try and model the staggered seam in Ansys, which might be difficult. Whichever tube matches the simulation will be the method I will use for my L1 rocket.

This interior molding tecnique can also be used for the nosecone, so I might do that.
