I created survey and python program to create a "compatibility score" for any two possible roommates. It considers over 30 different aspects of a roommate, such as common interests and living habits, etc. 

I distributed it on the Purdue Class of 2025 Discord server and it was used by over 150 students. It helped many people find freshman year roommates, including myself. I even had several people message me saying "Hey, I saw we got a high score on that rommate compadibility sheet".


There was already a spreadsheet circulating on the Discord server where over 100 students filled out information, however, such a large spreadsheet was difficult to analyze  to find roommates you might be similar to.

[The program](https://github.com/matt-lewton9/PurdueRoomate-Matcher) analyzed the unformatted text in the existing spreadsheet, and comapred the similarity of different rommate's entries to create a "compatibility score". It awarded weighted points for similar sleep schedules, music taste, majors, etc.

I later created a custom survey, that produced formatted data which could be more easily analyzed by the program.
