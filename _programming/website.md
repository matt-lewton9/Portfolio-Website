I built this website from scratch as one of my summer projects. I designed custom html templates, then the article and menu pages generate themselves via loops using Jeckyll. The article content was written in Markdown files, which is easier to write in than raw html.
 
I did the CSS styling myself without any libraries. I like darkmode and my favorite color is green. 

The coolest part of this website, is the gallery on the home page, which is generated from a YML datafile and a Liquid loop.
