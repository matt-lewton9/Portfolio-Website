My latest CS project is this website! It was built using Jeckyll, allowing me to create html templates using includes, write the article content in Markdown, and have the pages and menus generate themselves using loops. The coolest part of this website, is the gallery, which is generated from a YML datafile and a Liquid loop in the html.

The CSS styling was done myself without any libraries like Bootstrap. I like darkmode and my favorite color is green. 

The code is <a href="https://github.com/matt-lewton9/Portfolio-Website" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Github</a>.
