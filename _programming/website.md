I built this website from scratch in about 2 weeks as one of my summer projects. I designed custom html templates, so the article and menu pages generate themselves via loops using Jeckyll. This allows for the article content was written in Markdown, which is easier to write in than raw html.
 
I did the CSS styling myself without any libraries. I like darkmode and my favorite color is green. 

The coolest part of this website, is the gallery on the home page, which is entirely generated from a YML datafile, a Liquid loop, and CSS flex boxes.
