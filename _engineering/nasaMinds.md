## Project Overview

NASA MINDS is a national collegiate competition to develop something novel for the Artemis program.
For this competition, we designed and tested a lunar thermoelectric generator system which uses waste heat 
and the natural temperature gradient of lunar regolith to generate electricity on the moon. We recieved NASA funding to construct and test proposed thermoelectric system, and validated our results with thermal simulations. We recieved first place for our technical paper, and fourth place overall.

After the competition, conduted more comperhensive experiements which investgiatd design characteristics of the heat conductor assembly. We presented an expanded paper at IEEE MIT URTC 2021, which was published in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9701608" class="link">IEEE Xplore</a>.

## Concept

<img src="{{ "assets/images/HEAT SINK IMAGE" | relative_url }}" class="articleImg">

There is a large temperature difference, between the soil on the moon's surface, and just a few feet underground. This is because lunar soil's thermal conductivity increases with depth as it becomes more compact and dense (like sand at the beach). This project therorized that the lunar soil could be used as a heat sink for thermoelectric generator powered by solar radiation or waste heat from a lunar base.

## Design <img src="{{ "assets/images/TEG IMAGE" | relative_url }}" class="articleImg">

This is done by extending the cold side of the thermolelectric plates with a copper "radiator cylinder" to reach depths with a high thermal conductivity, which is insulated from the sides. The paper compares various aspects of the radiatore cylinder geometry both theoretically and experimentally.

To test this concept experimentally, we built a test apparatus to simulate the thermal conditions of the moon.
