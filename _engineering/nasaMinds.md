## Project Overview

NASA MINDS is a national collegiate competition to develop something novel for the Artemis program.
For this competition, we designed and tested a lunar thermoelectric generator system which uses waste heat 
and the natural temperature gradient of lunar regolith to generate electricity on the moon. We recieved NASA funding to construct and test proposed thermoelectric system, and validated our results with thermal simulations. We recieved first place for our technical paper, and fourth place overall.

After the competition, conduted more comperhensive experiements which investgiatd design characteristics of the heat conductor assembly. We presented an expanded paper at IEEE MIT URTC 2021, which was published in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9701608" class="link">IEEE Xplore</a>.
